# Linear-Regression
Predicting the mpg(Mileage per gallon) of a car using Linear-Regression model
# Assumptions for linear regression:
1. Linear relationship - Linear regression needs linear relationship b/w Independent variable(x) and dependent variable(y).
2. Normality - Linear regression requires all the variables to be normally distributed. The error term is also should be ND. There should be no outliers in the data because Linear regresion is sensitive to outliers.
3. Multi-collinearity There should be very little or no multi-collinearity in the data. MC happens when the IV are too highly corelated with eachother. there are different methods to measure MC. They are as follows:
- Correlation matrix/ Heatmap
- Tolerance 
- VIF(variance inflation factor)
4. Homoscedasticity - The error terms must have constant variance wrt the regression lines. This phenomenon is called as Homoscedasticity. The presence of non constant variables refered as heteroscedasticity.
5. Autocorrelation - There should be no correlation b/w the error terms. Absence of correlation is called as autocorelation.
